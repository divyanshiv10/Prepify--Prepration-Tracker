PREPIFY- PREPRATION TRACKER
Prepify is a professional-grade study management dashboard designed to help students and developers turn overwhelming syllabi into clear, actionable roadmaps. The project addresses the common challenge of "preparation fatigue" by providing a high-contrast, visually immersive environment where progress is measured not just by time spent, but by specific topics mastered. Built with a focus on speed and security, it leverages modern cloud technologies to ensure your study data is synchronized and accessible across all your devices.

How It Works
1)Secure Sign-In: Users begin by signing into a private workspace via a secure authentication screen powered by Firebase.

2)Goal Initialization: Create high-level study goals (e.g., "Web Development", "SQL", or "DSA") to serve as parent containers for your roadmap.

3)Topic Mapping: Break each major goal down into individual study nodes or specific tasks to make the syllabus manageable.

4)Mastery Tracking: Mark topics as finished to trigger real-time mastery calculations and update dynamic circular progress gauges.

5)Cloud Persistence: Every milestone is automatically saved to Cloud Firestore, allowing you to pick up exactly where you left off from any device.
